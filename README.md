# Budweiser-Case-Study-1
Budweiser Case Study 1 by Megan Riley and Edgar Nunez


In this case study we examine a list of Beers and Breweries in the United States. During this analysis we examine some basic summary statistics. We compare and analyze the associated ABV and IBU values. We build a KNN model to differentiate between Ales and IPAs and finally introduce new data on beer consumption to compare producing and consuming states. 

The .rmd file in this repository is where all the code is housed, it is used to write the entire html knit file. It references the three data files (Beers, Brewereies, BeerConsumption) as local files.
